    <h1>Hello, Internet!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! It's a work in progress as I learn <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> from a <em>terriffic</em> class I'm taking at <a href="https://launchschool.com">Launch School</a>. I'm learning a lot! Why don't you join me?</p>
    <p class="details">There's not a lot of material on this page as I'm playing around with HTML &amp; CSS.  When I'm done the last two paragraphs will take on a lighter color than the first - the "class" attribute on the two &lt;p&gt; tags and a bit of CSS will help accomplish that.</p>
    <p class="details" id="last">This is the final paragraph. It also uses the `class` attribute as well as an `id` attribute. We'll use some CSS and the `id` attribute to underline the entire parargaph.</p>
